            <h1>EATING 3D</h1>
            <p>Ever since the early 1990s 3D printing was beginning to get people’s attention but it was not after the mid-2000s that it was possible to own a 3D printer at home. These printers can print in 3D but it is usually in plastic today with the technological advancements we got in this technology, foods can be 3D printed. It’s mostly available in stores and one type of food at once but it is very promising. Today’s use for this type of food is in the luxury department where only a small portion of the food can be served in a fancy manner but hopefully in the future desserts and meals can be 3D printed to make the preparation process identical and faster.</p>

                <p>I went to a new restaurant called Food Lazer where they had an open house for a new dessert recipe they wanted to try out. They had a big table with about 20 3D printers which were bigger than the classic ones which used plastic instead of food. The restaurant owners then demonstrated that they could print and cook in one minute a pancake that was shaped in a cool way. It seems that this technology can only be used in gourmet dishes for now not only because the restaurant was pretty fancy but because the portions were pretty small. Although, after the presentation, I got myself 10 of these pancakes for 10$ and they had some free chocolate 3D cubes at the counter. This means that it's more likely that 3D gourmet dishes will be more accessible to people because they are cheaper. After all, they are perfect, fast to make and multiple can be done at once. This new food technology is exciting and I can’t wait to see what they have in store for 3D foods in the future.</p>
