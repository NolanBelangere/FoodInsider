            <h1>EATING TEACHNOLOGY</h1>
            <p>	Meals of the future which we have access to today are mostly in the form of liquids which have been made by adding a powder and water together. Although limited to this day, these drinks such as Solyent and Huel shows that it is possible to have 100% of the daily food requirements with all vitamins needed for a productive mindset and physique. They aren't the best tasting but with additives from the user’s choice and default flavors like (pineapple, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate…) can make it more enjoyable for anyone that wants a quick meal.</p>

                <p>II wanted to try out these drinks for myself, so I decided to order enough for a week. I got both starter packs for around 230$ then started only drinking these powder drinks although it is not something which is recommended for a long period of time. The first day it was mostly exciting trying out new flavors and finding out if one will be better than the other. There was some of the taste that they said there were but also a bit chalky and oaty. After a bottle of it, I felt good and continued with my day. After three days, there is a feeling that you are hungry. This is most likely because the body is not used to having only food that isn’t whole. I also did not have any preferences between the two brands but Solent had that chocolate flavor which states slightly better. For the next few days, I fixed this problem by buying “Soylent Squared Chocolate Brownie” bars which helped a lot. When the last day came there was not much change but I know now that it is possible to live off powdered water and bars. The only thing is that it is very expensive if you don't have a reason to buy these kinds of foods. Overall, if you care for the environment and disagree with the current animal farming methods this is a great product for you, just don't forget these chocolate brownie bars!</p>
