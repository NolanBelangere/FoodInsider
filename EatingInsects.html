            <h1>EATING INSECTS</h1>
            <p>Insects are the first thing that someone being asked about future foods will answer. The idea of eating this type of food would make anyone uncomfortable. In reality, these little critters could make for a great meal in the future. Insects are already available for eating, but only on a smaller scale. Insects also have a lot of nutrients and proteins for their small size!</p>

                <h1 class ="page-title">CRITIC</h1>
                <p>I went to Ali’s Grill to try out some of these insects for myself. When I went to this restaurant, there was a strange smell of grilled chicken. This thanksgiving aroma was pleasant compared to the source of it… Insects! There were so many of them per tray, all shapes and colors which immediately made me uncomfortable. Anyways, I ordered 10 crickets, 5 grubs and one of these fat cockroaches. When they came to my table it was pretty fast but the ones on display were just for show. The fresh ones I got were all grilled but that cockroach was way too big! The grubs were fine, a bit liquidy on the inside but overall, it was like a long chip that was dipped in water… stopped at 1.5. The crickets were very cooked and almost no liquid was left making this one the best, it was like puffed beacon. It was good enough and the price of 2$ for all my insects makes you wonder if they are making any income out of that. I recommend Ali’s Grill for anyone who is not scared of cooked insects.</p>
